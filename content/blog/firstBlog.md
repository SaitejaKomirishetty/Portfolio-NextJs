# Getting Started with Next.js and React

Welcome to my first blog post! In this article, I'll share my experience building modern web applications with **Next.js** and **React**.

## Why I Chose Next.js

Next.js has become my go-to framework for React applications because of several key features:

-   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and performance
-   **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Fast loading times
-   **API Routes**: Built-in backend functionality
-   **File-based routing**: Intuitive project structure

### Key Benefits

1. **Performance**: Next.js optimizes your app automatically
2. **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading and excellent tooling
3. **Production Ready**: Built-in optimizations for production

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a Next.js component:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Best Practices

> **Pro Tip**: Always use TypeScript with Next.js for better type safety and developer experience.

When building with Next.js, remember to:

-   Use the `Image` component for optimized images
-   Implement proper SEO with metadata
-   Follow the file-based routing conventions
-   Use environment variables for configuration

## Conclusion

Next.js has revolutionized how I build web applications. The combination of React's component model with Next.js's powerful features creates an excellent development experience.
